# Operators
Operators are a part of the core principles of math. Each math operator does something different to the number. In coding, operators are almost the exact same, with some additional operators being added to use. This page will cover a lot of the operators that're used only in coding, as well as a couple rarely seen operators.

## Operators in JS
JavaScript operators are actually very nice, in the sense that they don't change a whole lot from operators used in coding in general. **JS**, to my knowledge, only has a couple exclusive operators.

There are three basic types of operators:
- Conditional
- Mutable
- Convenience

## Conditional Operators
Conditional Operators are used to check for conditional statements, and return a `true` or `false` value, depending upon the result of the checked condition. They're used in tandem with `if` statements to create conditional code.
